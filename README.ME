The pipeline defined in `Jenkinsfile` runs the following stages:

1. **Checkout**
   - Pulls the latest code from the `main` branch.

2. **Build**
   - Builds a Docker image using the `Dockerfile`.
   - Tags the image as `my-simple-app`.

3. **Test**
   - *(You can add test scripts here)*

4. **Deploy**
   - Stops and removes any existing container named `myapp`.
   - Runs the new Docker container in detached mode.

## 🐳 Dockerfile

A simple Python application is containerized using `python:3.9-slim`.

It:
- Sets the working directory to `/app`
- Copies `requirements.txt` and installs dependencies
- Copies the app code and runs `app.py`

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Make sure Jenkins is installed and has access to Docker.
2. Create a Jenkins Pipeline job.
3. Use **"Pipeline script from SCM"** and point it to this GitHub repo.
4. Trigger the build.

## 📂 Example `requirements.txt`

```text
flask
requests
